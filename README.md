# scoping-fairness-in-risk-prediction

Refers to the process of defining, assessing, and addressing fairness concerns within the context of predictive models that estimate the risk of developing a health outcome of interest.

Identifying Bias: Examining the model and the data it uses to identify any existing biases. This can include analysing how different groups are represented in the data and how the model's predictions vary across these groups.

Assessing Impact: Evaluating the consequences of any identified biases. This involves understanding how unfair predictions can affect the individuals or groups being assessed by the model.

Mitigating Bias: Developing and implementing strategies to reduce or eliminate bias in the risk prediction model. This might involve altering the data or adjusting the model's algorithm.
